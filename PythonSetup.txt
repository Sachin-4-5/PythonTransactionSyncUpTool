Python Setup in VSC
-------------------

2. Install it.
3. Download/Install Python By Microsoft extension inside Visual Studio Code.
4. Create one project folder.
5. Open folder using VSC.
6. Create virtual environment (one per project). It keeps project packages separate. Also upgrade pip its a good practice (good hygience)
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1		(Python terminal using powershell as default)
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  
7. Always check correct python interpreter is selected
   open any .py file --> bottom right corner it should come like 3.11.9 (venv)
   
8. Install all project dependencies/packages using below commands - 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
9. Always we should use PyInstaller for building .exe to deploy it on different server. So, that (venv) do not needs to be deployed.
